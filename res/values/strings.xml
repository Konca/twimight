collection. The Twimight Beta application will collect data that samples
Twimight application usage statistics and my location during application
usage.

I understand that access to any data collected will only be allowed
to the members of the Twimight research team and only for the purpose of
research performed in the context of the Twimight project. Any published
results of this study will only refer to anonymised and obfuscated data,
and aggregated statistics that do not reveal the identities of the
participants. As a participant I have the right to opt out of this study at
any time during this experiment by uninstalling the application. Moreover,
I have the right to access any information in the data set related to me,
and request for all collected data to be removed. As a user of Twimight
Beta I may participate in the Twimight Beta online competition.</string>
